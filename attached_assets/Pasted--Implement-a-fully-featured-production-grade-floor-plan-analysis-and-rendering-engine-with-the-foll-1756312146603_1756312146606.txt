 Implement a fully featured, production-grade floor plan analysis and rendering engine with the following capabilities:

Advanced CAD File Processing

Parse multi-sheet DXF/DWG/PDF files with layer-aware extraction.
Detect and classify architectural elements: walls (black lines), restricted zones (light blue), entrances/exits (red), doors/windows with swing directions.
Automatically identify main floor plan among multiple views.
Perform accurate scaling, unit conversion, and geometric element recognition.
Pixel-Perfect Floor Plan Rendering

Render walls as thick gray lines (
#6B7280
), restricted areas in blue (
#3B82F6
), entrances/exits in red (
#EF4444
) with curved door swings.
Use SVG or Canvas for smooth zoom, pan, and scalable vector output.
Include a clear, interactive legend matching the color scheme.
Maintain professional architectural line weights, spacing, and proportions.
Support real-time user interaction for highlighting zones.
Intelligent Îlot Placement Engine

Accept user-defined layout profiles (10%, 25%, 30%, 35%).
Automatically place îlots (furniture blocks) in available zones, avoiding red and blue areas.
Allow îlots to touch black walls except near entrances.
Ensure no îlot overlaps or touches restricted zones.
Optimize placement for maximum usable space and accessibility.
Color-code îlots by size category with outlined styling.
Corridor Network Generation

Automatically generate mandatory corridors between facing îlot rows.
Corridors must be configurable in width (default 1.2m), touch both îlot rows, and never overlap îlots.
Use graph-based pathfinding and minimum spanning tree algorithms to optimize corridor layout.
Display corridors as pink/red lines with area labels (e.g., 5.50m²).
Maintain visual hierarchy: walls, îlots, corridors, labels.
User Interface & Experience

Modern, stylish UI with professional typography and consistent color schemes.
Use attractive background images from Pexels.
Provide interactive editing for îlot placement and corridor adjustments.
Real-time updates reflecting user changes and constraints.
Export & Output

Export high-resolution images, vector PDFs, and CAD files preserving all visual and geometric details.
Ensure scalable, print-ready outputs with precise measurements and annotations.
3D Visualization (Optional Advanced Phase)

Render realistic 3D views of the floor plan including corridors, dining, hallways, bedrooms, washrooms, etc.
Support multiple angles and interactive navigation.
Strictly avoid any simplifications, prototypes, mocks, or basic implementations. Deliver a robust, standalone, and fully operational system capable of processing any CAD floor plan file into a professional, architecturally accurate, and visually detailed layout with interactive îlot placement and corridor generation, fully respecting all geometric and architectural rules.

==========

Review and fix the entire project to implement a fully featured, production-grade floor plan analysis and rendering engine with these precise capabilities:

Advanced CAD File Processing: Parse multi-sheet DXF/DWG/PDF files with layer-aware extraction; detect and classify architectural elements (walls in black, restricted zones in light blue, entrances/exits in red, doors/windows with swing directions); automatically identify the main floor plan; perform accurate scaling, unit conversion, and geometric recognition.

Pixel-Perfect Floor Plan Rendering: Render walls as thick gray lines (
#6B7280
), restricted areas in blue (
#3B82F6
), entrances/exits in red (
#EF4444
) with curved door swings; use SVG or Canvas for smooth zoom, pan, and scalable vector output; include an interactive legend matching the color scheme; maintain professional architectural line weights, spacing, and proportions; support real-time user interaction for highlighting zones.

Intelligent Îlot Placement Engine: Accept user-defined layout profiles (10%, 25%, 30%, 35% coverage); automatically place îlots (furniture blocks) in available zones avoiding red and blue areas; allow îlots to touch black walls except near entrances; ensure no îlot overlaps or touches restricted zones; optimize placement for maximum usable space and accessibility; color-code îlots by size category with outlined styling.

Corridor Network Generation: Automatically generate mandatory corridors between facing îlot rows; corridors configurable in width (default 1.2m), touching both îlot rows without overlapping îlots; use graph-based pathfinding and minimum spanning tree algorithms to optimize corridor layout; display corridors as pink/red lines with area labels; maintain visual hierarchy: walls, îlots, corridors, labels.

Strictly avoid any simplifications, demos, fallbacks, fakes, basics, mocks, or prototypes. Deliver a robust, standalone, fully operational system capable of processing any CAD floor plan file into a professional, architecturally accurate, visually detailed layout with interactive îlot placement and corridor generation, fully respecting all geometric and architectural rules.

After fixing all issues and completing the implementation, provide a clean, well-organized project directory tree and detailed instructions for building and running the project successfully.
