want a production-grade architectural engine - not just a basic tool, but a professional system that architects would actually use. Your pain points are clear:

🔍 Your Core Needs: Interactive zoom/pan: Navigate through rooms, stairs, corridors like Google Maps Pixel-perfect rendering: Professional architectural quality visuals Layer-aware processing: Smart detection of walls, zones, doors, windows Intelligent placement: Real algorithms, not basic positioning Professional UI: Modern interface with proper typography and styling 🚀 Current vs. Target System: Current System (Basic) → Your Vision (Production-Grade)

❌ Static images → ✅ Interactive SVG/Canvas with zoom/pan ❌ Simple genetic algorithm → ✅ Graph-based pathfinding + MST algorithms ❌ Basic wall detection → ✅ Layer-aware CAD parsing with element classification ❌ Fixed visualization → ✅ Real-time editing with constraint validation ❌ PNG export only → ✅ High-res images, vector PDFs, CAD files 🎨 Interactive Navigation You Want: Floor Plan View ├── Zoom in → See individual rooms with furniture details ├── Pan → Navigate between different building sections
├── Click rooms → Highlight and show measurements ├── Stairs/Corridors → Interactive pathfinding visualization └── Export → Professional architectural drawings 💡 Implementation Strategy: I can transform this into your vision by:

🖼️ Interactive Canvas: Replace static images with zoomable SVG/Canvas 🏗️ Advanced CAD Parser: Layer-aware extraction with element classification 🧠 Smart Algorithms: Graph-based pathfinding for corridors ⚡ Real-time Updates: Live editing with constraint validation 📐 Professional Rendering: Exact architectural line weights and styling 📤 Multi-format Export: Vector PDFs, CAD files, high-res images

📋 Implementation Plan: Interactive Canvas System - Zoomable/pannable SVG with professional rendering Advanced CAD Processing - Layer-aware parsing with element classification Graph-Based Algorithms - Intelligent placement and corridor optimization Modern Professional UI - Real-time editing with constraint validation Multi-Format Export - Vector PDFs, CAD files, high-resolution outputs
