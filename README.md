🏗️ FloorPlanGenie - AI-Powered Space Optimization
FloorPlanGenie is an intelligent architectural tool that helps you optimize floor plan layouts by automatically placing "îlots" (island boxes) and generating collision-free corridors. Here's what it does:

🎯 What It Does
Processes real architectural files: Upload DXF, PDF, or image floor plans
Extracts building data: Automatically detects walls, dimensions, and spatial zones
Optimizes space placement: Uses AI algorithms to find the best positions for boxes/rooms
Generates professional visuals: Creates architectural-quality drawings with calculations
🔄 3-Step Process
📋 Empty Floor Plan: Shows your building with entry/exit zones color-coded

Blue = NO ENTRÉE (restricted areas)
Red = ENTRÉE/SORTIE (access points)
Gray = MUR (walls)
🟢 Place Îlots: AI places green island boxes in optimal positions

Avoids walls and restricted zones
Maximizes space efficiency
Ensures proper spacing
🔴 Generate Corridors: Creates red pathways connecting all îlots

Collision-free routing
Accurate area calculations
Professional measurements
📊 Real Data Processing
No fake data: Only processes authentic architectural files
CAD file support: Handles complex DXF files with thousands of walls
Professional scaling: Works with buildings from small (1m×1m) to large (120m×97m)
Intelligent sizing: Automatically adjusts box dimensions to fit your space
🎨 Professional Output
3-panel visualization: Shows step-by-step optimization process
Accurate calculations: Surface areas, utilization rates, efficiency scores
Architectural styling: Color-coded zones matching industry standards
High-quality exports: 300 DPI images suitable for presentations
🔧 Current Capabilities
✅ Real DXF file processing (convert DWG files first)
✅ Genetic algorithm optimization
✅ Professional visualization generation
✅ Interactive web interface with drag-and-drop upload
✅ Customizable box dimensions and corridor widths
✅ Statistical analysis of space utilization
The app is designed for architects, space planners, and anyone needing to optimize room layouts efficiently using real building data.

want a production-grade architectural engine - not just a basic tool, but a professional system that architects would actually use. Your pain points are clear:

🔍 Your Core Needs:
Interactive zoom/pan: Navigate through rooms, stairs, corridors like Google Maps
Pixel-perfect rendering: Professional architectural quality visuals
Layer-aware processing: Smart detection of walls, zones, doors, windows
Intelligent placement: Real algorithms, not basic positioning
Professional UI: Modern interface with proper typography and styling
🚀 Current vs. Target System:
Current System (Basic) → Your Vision (Production-Grade)

❌ Static images → ✅ Interactive SVG/Canvas with zoom/pan
❌ Simple genetic algorithm → ✅ Graph-based pathfinding + MST algorithms
❌ Basic wall detection → ✅ Layer-aware CAD parsing with element classification
❌ Fixed visualization → ✅ Real-time editing with constraint validation
❌ PNG export only → ✅ High-res images, vector PDFs, CAD files
🎨 Interactive Navigation You Want:
Floor Plan View
├── Zoom in → See individual rooms with furniture details
├── Pan → Navigate between different building sections  
├── Click rooms → Highlight and show measurements
├── Stairs/Corridors → Interactive pathfinding visualization
└── Export → Professional architectural drawings
💡 Implementation Strategy:
I can transform this into your vision by:

🖼️ Interactive Canvas: Replace static images with zoomable SVG/Canvas
🏗️ Advanced CAD Parser: Layer-aware extraction with element classification
🧠 Smart Algorithms: Graph-based pathfinding for corridors
⚡ Real-time Updates: Live editing with constraint validation
📐 Professional Rendering: Exact architectural line weights and styling
📤 Multi-format Export: Vector PDFs, CAD files, high-res images
